# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in using REACT to make a simple web browser version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with the following features:
-The game is between two actual players (no computer opponent)
-The game is played in the same browser window
-Messages are shown for which player, "X" or "O", has the next move and who won.
All functions are within the same browser and nothing is saved.

Usage: 
1. Download/copy the files and folders to a local folder. 
2. If using Node.js, open the command line point to the root folder of the target files, for example "cd path/to/TicTacToe". 
3. Then run "npm install" to install all dependencies, and then run "http-server ./public" to start the server. 
4. Then view the page by navigating to the following URL in a web browser: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html" (default IP address and port number is shown). 

The output should include the following:
-The game board.
-Tiles showing "+", which change to "X" or "O" depending on the player that picked them. 
-A message showing which player has the next move and who won.
The output should look like this:

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding features for to reset the game and to keep track of the number of wins for each player. This could include a best of 3,5, or 7 games feature to decide the overall winner.
